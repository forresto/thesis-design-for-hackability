\begin_layout Standard
The main objective of this project is to design a modular dataflow visual
 programming framework using web technologies.
 The framework should empower non-coders to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hack
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 creative web apps by configuring wires that represent how modules communicate.
 There should be a simple syntax to define the inputs and outputs of a module.
 Apps created with the framework should have source code that is easy to
 read and share.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To this end, I have designed and created a web-based framework called Meemoo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within this framework, an 
\emph on
app
\emph default
 is a collection of modules and the wires that connect them.
 A 
\emph on
module
\emph default
 is a web page that can live anywhere online, and use any web technology.
 This web page includes JavaScript that defines the module's inputs and
 outputs: what data is accepted and what kind of data will be sent.
 The 
\emph on
wires
\emph default
 define where each module sends data.
 The source code of the app that defines an its layout, routing, and state
 can be saved and shared with a small amount of text.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo is programmed by connecting boxes with wires, putting programming
 within reach of non-coders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far I have focused module development on realtime animation tools, as
 this makes it simple to explain and engage creatively with the concept.
 It is not limited to animation though; any app or system that can be described
 by a dataflow graph can be made into a Meemoo app.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did not start making Meemoo as an educational tool, but I have since been
 influenced by software projects inspired by Constructionist learning theory:
 Logo, Smalltalk, and Scratch.
 As I have read texts on Constructionism, I have seen many parallels to
 my own experiences as a learner.
 I think that Meemoo has the potential to be a good tool for learning by
 making.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The people that created the vision of the personal computer wanted everybody
 to be able to create their own tools.
 Learning traditional computer programming takes a major commitment, and
 most people are satisfied with the tools that come with the computer or
 are offered as services online.
 Meemoo is a toolmaker that makes it easier for people to create and modify
 their own digital tools and therefore to invent new media.
 
\end_layout

Meemoo has many influences and precedents in the way that it has been designed,
 some direct and others indirect.

\begin_layout Quote
hacker: n.
 [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
1.
 A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how
 to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to
 learn only the minimum necessary.
 RFC1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person
 who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings
 of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

 [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information
 by poking around.
 Hence password hacker, network hacker.
 The correct term for this sense is cracker.

 For the purpose of this thesis and project I will use and promote the first

Hackability: n.
 design that encourages understanding and modification.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In this context, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hackability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to design that encourages understanding of the workings of a system,
 in a addition to the ability to modify said system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might be a lost cause to try to reclaim this term from its common cultural
 understanding.
 The Maker Movement, which also places value in understanding and modifying
 systems and things, does not have such negative baggage with their moniker,
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

make
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maker
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seem like more constructive terms.
 Although it is not perfect, I will stick to the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hackability,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as I think that it encompasses the spirit that I want to promote with regards
 to software.
\end_layout

Designing for hackability implies respect.
 The designer of a hackable thing acknowledges that they cannot imagine
 every potential use, so they enable people to modify it to their will and
 connect it to other things.
 This quality can apply to software, physical artifacts, and services.

In the course of this thesis I will refer to programming and coding as distinct
 skills.
 Learning to program is a process of learning to manipulate logical structures.
 Learning to code puts those structures into a linear-textual format that
 computers can parse.
 Different programmable systems emphasize and abstract these aspects differently.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some media observers, myself included, saw the rise of touchscreen devices
 like the iPhone and iPad as a step backwards for participatory media.
 As originally marketed, these devices were designed primarily for media
 consumption.
 When Apple later opened up the App Store they took a timid step towards
 hackability by allowing third party developers to create apps that extend
 the functionality of the device.
 I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

timid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because only developers that pay for the privilege can write apps for these
 devices, and only apps that pass an opaque curation process are allowed
 in the App Store.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of this closed ecosystem and technical limitations, the design of
 apps for iOS tend to have low to no hackability.
 In general, an app is designed to do one thing.
 The designer decides what the app does, how it communicates, where things
 can be shared.
 The user then uses the app.
 The designer/user roles tend to be well-defined in this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard icon for an app looks like a shiny glass object (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), which mirrors the aesthetics of the device itself.
 It symbolizes something highly designed and polished, not to be opened.
 For both the device and the apps that run on it, the design implies

no user serviceable parts inside.

 These three apps are development environments that deal with the affordances
 and constraints of writing code on touchscreen devices in different ways.
 For example, Codea uses the affordances of touch-screen interaction to
 manipulate variables with widgets embedded in the code, like popup number
 sliders and color pickers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, without an external keyboard, any kind of extended writing on touchscre
en devices is a difficult task.
 It is also against Apple's regulations to load external scripts in native
 apps, which makes it hard to share code.
 Programs that you code in these apps can only run in the

 to describe their vision of the computer as a medium that can be all other
 media.
 Unlike broadcast media which is passively consumed, computer media can
 also be participatory and active.
 This means that people can create and consume media on the same tool.

I suggest that Kay and others aimed to create a particular kind of new media--ra
ther than merely simulating the appearances of old ones.
 These new media use already existing representational formats as their
 building blocks, while adding many new previously nonexistent properties.
 At the same time, as envisioned by Kay, these media are expandable--that
 is, users themselves should be able to easily add new properties, as well
 as to invent new media.

The term

Web 2.0
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is used to describe the rise of online services that facilitate publishing
 content.
 This began with blogging services like LiveJournal in 1999, photo sharing
 sites like Flickr in 2004, and video sharing sites like Youtube in 2005.
 These services helped make the web more participatory, giving any person
 with internet access the ability to publish text, images, and video.
 Web 2.0 makes media distribution easier by abstracting away the need to
 learn about web servers and HTML.

 His editor shows the output of the code in real-time, without needing to
 change windows, compile, or save and refresh.
 Any number or color in the source code opens a slider or color picker,
 which immediately changes the visual output (Figure ).
 As somebody with experience coding visual applications in JavaScript, Flash,
 and Processing, this demonstration was like seeing the light.
 Suddenly I could see that my normal workflow--the need to save or recompile,
 change modes, and refresh between changing code and seeing the result--is
 a huge waste of time and mental energy.

As computers became smaller and more common in classrooms, the signature
 Logo turtle was added to the system.
 This was a graphical representation of a turtle that would draw lines on
 the screen based on the instructions given by the child.
 For example,

 This small program draws a star (Figure

 By making the commands relative to the current position of the turtle,
 the language is easier to learn than a graphical drawing system based on

Smalltalk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fundamental requirement for the DynaBook research project was to create
 a system that could be programmed by the user.
 Kay invented Smalltalk and object-oriented programming for the Dynabook
 prototype system to lower the barrier to entry for coding.
 Object-oriented programming splits code into logical classes that define
 the data for the object and the methods that access or modify that data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In tests some children programmed their own tools, like a twelve-year-old
 girl's painting application and a fifteen-year-old boy's circuit design
 application.
 Kay later referred to these impressive results as "early success syndrome."

Scratch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Text-based programming languages have different requirements for syntax,
 punctuation, and indentation that if not followed perfectly will result
 in programs that do not run as expected (or at all).
 This can be frustrating for beginners and experienced coders alike--most
 of my programming errors are missing semicolons or mismatched brackets.
 The creators of Scratch designed a coding system that works around syntax
 and the frustration of syntax errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scratch uses drag-and-drop 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

code blocks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of a text-based syntax, which makes coding less error-prone for
 beginners.
 These code blocks snap together only in ways that make syntactic sense.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Control structures (like 
\family typewriter
forever
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\family default
) are C-shaped to suggest that blocks should be placed inside them.
 Blocks that output values are shaped according to the types of values they
 return: ovals for numbers and hexagons for Booleans.
 Conditional blocks (like 
\family typewriter
if
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
repeat-until
\family default
) have hexagon-shaped voids, indicating a Boolean is required.

Although creating a script with code blocks is more like snapping Legos
 together than writing code, it is still coding.
 The shape of the control structures is a direct metaphor to how code works,

 I imagine those logical structures are transferable to textual coding.

 I did not have this final output planned from the start.
 The available blocks influenced the direction of my exploration.
 For example, the last change was adding the drum sound when I saw that
 it was as easy as adding one more block to the script.
 Making something with comparable collision detection, color cycling, and
 audio triggering in Flash or Processing would have taken much longer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was my first Scratch project, and from launching the environment for
 the first time it only took about thirty minutes to snap it together.
 Granted, I am an experienced coder, but I try new languages and coding
 systems on occasion, and Scratch was by far the fastest and easiest to
 create something interesting.
 I look forward to playing with it more.

Previous work and motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My motivation to make this project comes from years of experimenting with
 digital technologies.
 I have worked in different languages and environments, but the ability
 to share my work online has always brought me back to working with web
 technologies.
 I make my experiments into online creative tools (web apps) in order to
 see how other people use my creations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have experience with two dataflow visual programming environments: Quartz
 Composer and Pure Data.
 The feeling of direct manipulation and immediate feedback in working with
 these environments appealed to me.
 They were able to do graphics and audio processing beyond my coding ability
 at the time, so I was able to explore new kinds of audio/visual experiments.
 They are great tools for interactive installations, but it is impossible
 to use them for creating web apps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the past two years browser capabilities have increased and JavaScript
 engines have been made fast enough that audio/visual programming is now
 possible with web standards.
 I realized that I could make my own visual programming environment with
 features that appealed to me from different paradigms: modularity, reconfigurab
ility, instant feedback, and shareability.
 Creating a new creative tool is just a matter of wiring some modules together.
 I can write new modules in code that I am already comfortable with.
 Things made with this toolmaker are easily shared online.

\begin_layout Standard
I hope that Meemoo might enable somebody to explore creative programming
 in the same way that my capabilities and imagination were extended with
 Quartz Composer.

\begin_layout Standard
Because of timing or school priorities, I was not part of the small generation
 of students that was exposed to BASIC or LOGO programming in elementary
 school.
 I remained interested in computers, spending any time that I could get
 my hands on them on shareware games and paint programs.
 I did not get into programming until high school, in two very different
 ways: Texas Instruments graphing calculators and web programming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My higher-level math classes used TI-8x series of graphing calculators.
 These have the ability to write and run programs with a BASIC-like syntax.
 My first program mirrored a game played by many children on standard calculator
s: the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+1 game.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This game is played by pressing the buttons [1] [+] [1] [=], and then pressing
 [=] as fast as possible.
 This makes the calculator into a counter, and we would have races to see
 who could press [=] the most times in one minute.
 Pressing buttons seems to be a common interest for children.
 When a system reacts to the button press, it gives the child a sense of
 control.
 The program that I wrote was just a few lines of code.
 It counted from zero, adding one and displaying the result in an infinite
 loop as fast as the calculator could go.
 I had automated the +1 game, taking out the button-pressing dynamic.
 It was satisfying to see the numbers flying by on the screen.
 I then made a new version of the script that printed the Fibonacci sequence
 in the same manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I then figured out how to script complicated graphic drawings with these
 small machines.
 I would watch with interest as the calculator slowly rendered patterns
 from my scripts, one stroke at a time.
 This was my first experience with programming graphics.
 I never managed to make a program draw what I originally had in mind, but
 this was not discouraging.
 The serendipitous monochrome images that emerged from my experiments encouraged
 me to explore different directions, and create new challenges for myself.
 I learned a lot about cartesian geometry, algebra, and logic from these
 code explorations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The availability of the Internet in my home spurred the second programming
 interest.
 It was empowering to publish my first web site.
 It was a place where I could freely express myself in many different ways.
 Anybody in the world could see it, through the same window and at the same
 size and resolution as the websites of corporations, governments, and universit
ies.
 Learning how to create and post webpages gave me a level of active participatio
n that other media had not offered me.

\begin_layout Standard
I learned web programming by example, mostly thanks to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

view source

 command on the browser.
 I would take a little bit of code from a tutorial, some code from another
 page's source, and tinker and experiment with the combination in an editor
 that showed both the code and output in the same window.
 These web programming experiments continued from this time and have culminated
 in this thesis project.

In order to test the user experience of the framework, I did in-person talk-alou

 I had people interact with Meemoo, sometimes freely and sometimes with
 prompts or goals to accomplish.
 As they interacted with the system, I asked them to speak their thought
 process aloud as much as possible.
 This method of user testing allows the tester to listen in to the thought
 process of the person using the system, making it easy to identify points
 of frustration.

Creating 'possibility spaces' can be exciting for a number of reasons...
 but also can be a false God.
 It can be an excuse to never to actually grapple with whether there is
 value in the output itself, whether beauty is enough, whether people actually
 want what you are making, etc...

\begin_layout Standard
Partially thanks to this provocation, I decided to find a venue to perform
 with Meemoo in a live setting.
 I was invited to do visuals for a Zodiak's Side-Step dance festival club
 night.
 I used the gig as an opportunity to push Meemoo development and pressure-test
 the live-animation features.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the gig I made some special modules for creating a "world" into which
 I could insert animated sprites.
 On the software development side, I am happy that I decided to make two
 modules (Controller and World) share the same Backbone model.
 Each module has its own view of the same model, so the data passed through
 the wire will be the same on both sides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the party started and I was still coding furiously, adding features to
 the world module.
 Thirty minutes later the music tempo picked up, inviting people to the
 dance floor, and I made myself declare the coding done for the night.
 It was a thrill to see the first sprite hit the dance floor: multicolored
 glitter swirling in water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used clay and construction paper (and some glitter) as the basic building
 blocks of the visuals.
 I am attracted to the textures and imperfections that come from using materials
 like these.
 Using the taptempo module, I synced the sprites' animation to the music's
 beat.
 It was fun to build these tiny animations and then throw them onto the
 screens around the dance floor.

There are lots of improvements and ideas that came up in the evening:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Camera: I used a Sony Eyetoy webcam, which had unsatisfactory color reproduction.
 I chose art supplies with rich colors, but most of the color was washed
 out in the first step.
 Next time I will do some tests to find a better camera.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Audience participation: I planned to use Kinect to get silhouettes of people
 dancing into the world, but ran out of time.
 I was imagining using different animated textures for specified depth ranges.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Flocking: I only had time to implement the tiled animation.
 The original concept was that sprites could be individual or flocks that
 would move around the screens.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
UX tweaks: Confirm dialog on every delete got annoying when juggling around
 modules.
 A method for un/replugging wires that is more direct would make it quicker
 and easier to change the workings of the app.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I made a hack to open the World module in a new window to view it fullscreen
 on the projectors.
 I plan on making this a built-in feature for any module.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite these limitations, I got a lot of good feedback about the visuals.
 People were interested in what I was doing, and came around to play with
 the art supplies.
 Doing dance party visuals powered by a web browser was a fun experiment,
 and with a few more display options I think that the limitations would
 have been less aesthetically obvious.
 Performing under pressure was a good way to test the system.

This idea is bigger than one developer and one master's thesis.

\begin_layout Section
Community for sharing apps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo was designed for sharing.
 I would like to take elements of an App Store, Reddit, and Github to create
 a community for sharing and forking Meemoo apps.
 Because of the small amount of source code to describe a Meemoo app (Algorithm
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "alg:Meemoo-App-Source"

\end_inset

) it will be relatively easy to make the community scalable.

Touchscreen support

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo has the potential to become a powerful tool for creative programming
 on touchscreen devices.
 The library of modules reduces the need to write code in a text editor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gestures for zooming and panning are common in touchscreen interaction,
 and could be an intuitive way of navigating a Meemoo application.
 Since Meemoo runs in the browser, zooming and panning already work smoothly.
 Module dragging and wire connecting will take some more development time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo runs in browser, and in general JavaScript is slower than native
 code.
 However, as the power of these devices increases, the kinds of apps that
 can be built with Meemoo will likewise increase.
\end_layout

Code editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Websites such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

 are designed to streamline the experience of editing and sharing HTML experimen
ts and examples.
 The first screen of the site presents three text areas for HTML, CSS, and
 JavaScript, and a result frame that runs the web page output (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:jsFiddle"

\end_inset

).
 This site is used by JavaScript library developers to demonstrate bugs,
 as well as to make demonstrations for web programming questions and answers
 in forums such as StackOverflow.
 The immediacy of editing, saving, running, and sharing code in the browser
 makes this a time-saving tool for these communities.

I have been developing the first Meemoo modules using a traditional desktop
 code editor.
 I am used to switching between code editor and browser to test changes,
 and I probably make this mode switch hundreds of times per day.
 A code editor similar to jsFiddle that runs within Meemoo would eliminate
 the need to constantly switch applications to develop and test modules.
 Pressing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 From this view, there would be options to edit the current module (if you
 have access to it) or fork the module into a new one.

\begin_layout Standard
The open-source programming environment DesignBlocksJS (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Combining these concepts, you could have the higher-level wiring hackability
 of Meemoo, and the lower-level coding hackability of codeblocks to edit
 the source of a Meemoo module.
 Programming modules with codeblocks would be a good transitional step between
