\begin_layout Standard
The people that created the vision of the personal computer in the late
 1960s wanted everybody to be able to create their own tools (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Metamedia"

\end_inset

).
 Learning traditional computer programming still takes a major commitment,
 and most people are satisfied with the tools that come with the computer
 or are offered as services online.
 The barrier to entry to learning traditional programming involves setting
 up a programming environment, learning different systems for creating presentat
ion and logic, and learning different programming and markup languages and
 syntaxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People that overcome these barriers to entry are able to create software
 tools for themselves and others.
 People that create tools that are open to modification afford other people
 the ability to learn from their tools and build new tools on the old.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted to combine my programming experience with visual programming and
 creative web applications to make a framework for my own web experiments.
 I realized that I could make something with creative value to a wider audience
 by considering audiences for the framework other than myself -- programmers
 and non-programmers alike.
 Such a tool could invite people without coding experience to modify software
 tools and create their own.
 To this end, I have designed and created a web-based framework called Meemoo.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main objectives of this project: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design a modular dataflow visual programming framework using web technologies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The framework should afford non-coders the ability to modify creative web
 apps by configuring wires that represent how modules communicate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Apps created with the framework should have source code that is easy to
 read and share.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Web coders should be able to extend the framework by creating modules using
 web standards.
 There should be a simple syntax to define the inputs and outputs of a module.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within this framework, an 
\emph on
app
\emph default
 is a collection of modules and the wires that connect them.
 A 
\emph on
module
\emph default
 is a web page that can live anywhere online, and use any web technology.
 This web page includes JavaScript that defines the module's inputs and
 outputs: what data is accepted, how the data is processed, and what kind
 of data will be sent.
 The 
\emph on
wires
\emph default
 define where each module sends data.
 The source code of the app that defines an its layout, routing, and state
 can be saved and shared with a small amount of text.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo apps run in the web browser, so they will be able to run the same
 on PCs, smartphones, tablet computers, and soon TVs.
 Modifying and making new apps is done in the same browser interface, so
 no external developer tools are needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo is programmed by connecting boxes with wires (Figure

So far I have focused module development on realtime animation tools, as
 this makes it simple to explain and engage creatively with the concept.
 It is not limited to animation though; any app or system that can be described
 by a dataflow graph can be made into a Meemoo app.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I did not start making Meemoo as an educational tool, but I have since been
 influenced by software projects inspired by Constructionist learning theory:
 Logo, Smalltalk, and Scratch.
 As I have read texts on Constructionism, I have seen many parallels to
 my own experiences as a learner.
 I think that Meemoo has the potential to be a good tool for learning by
 making.

Context

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo has many influences and precedents in the way that it has been designed,
 some direct and others indirect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the course of this thesis I will refer to 
\emph on
programming
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
coding
\emph default
 as distinct skills.
 Learning to program is a process of learning to manipulate logical structures.
 Learning to code puts those structures into a linear-textual format that
 computers can parse.
 Different programmable systems emphasize and abstract these aspects differently.
 I will also use the term 
\emph on
people
\emph default
 instead of 
\emph on
users
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
developers
\emph default
, as I would like to make this distinction moot in the context of the project.

It might be a lost cause to try to reclaim this term from its common cultural

Designing for hackability implies respect.
 The designer of a hackable thing acknowledges that they cannot imagine
 every potential use, so they enable people to modify it to their will and
 connect it to other things.
 This quality can apply to software, physical artifacts, and services.

\begin_layout Standard
For software to be hackable the source code should be available under a
 free license (see

 While this enables other people with coding skills to modify a software
 project, I would like to expand the affordances of software hackability
 to non-coders.

I saw the rise of touchscreen devices like the iPhone and iPad as a step
 backwards for participatory media.
 As originally marketed, these devices were designed primarily for media
 consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Jobs2007"

\end_inset

.
 The only media production capabilities afforded by these devices was taking
 and sharing photos.
 When Apple later opened up the App Store they took a timid step towards
 hackability by allowing third party developers to create apps that extend
 the functionality of the device.
 I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

timid
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 because only developers that pay for the privilege can write apps for these
 devices, and only apps that pass an opaque curation process are allowed
 in the App Store

\begin_layout Standard
Because of this closed ecosystem and technical limitations, the design of
 apps for iOS tend to have low to no hackability.
 In general, an app is designed to do one thing.
 The designer decides what the app does, how it communicates, where things
 can be shared.
 The

 These three apps are development environments that deal with the affordances

However, without an external keyboard, any kind of extended writing on touchscre

 It is also against Apple's regulations to load external scripts in native

Putting all this together, we want an apparently free environment in which

 the magic is embedded in the familiar (Negroponte); and which acts as a
 magnifying mirror for the user's own intelligence (Coleridge).

I suggest that Kay and others aimed to create a particular kind of new media
 -- rather than merely simulating the appearances of old ones.
 These new media use already existing representational formats as their
 building blocks, while adding many new previously nonexistent properties.
 At the same time, as envisioned by Kay, these media are expandable -- that
 is, users themselves should be able to easily add new properties, as well
 as to invent new media.

 His editor shows the output of the code in real-time, without needing to
 change windows, compile, or save and refresh.
 Any number or color in the source code opens a slider or color picker,
 which immediately changes the visual output (Figure

 As somebody with experience coding visual applications in JavaScript, Flash,

 and refresh between changing code and seeing the result.

As computers became smaller and more common in classrooms, the signature
 Logo turtle was added to the system.
 This was a graphical representation of a turtle that would draw lines on
 the screen based on the instructions given by the child.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 tells the turtle

 right.

 This small program draws a star (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 By making the commands relative to the current position of the turtle,
 the language is easier to learn than a graphical drawing system based on
 Cartesian coordinates

Smalltalk (1972)

A fundamental requirement for the DynaBook research project was to create
 a system that could be programmed by the user.
 Kay invented Smalltalk and object-oriented programming for the Dynabook
 prototype system to lower the barrier to entry for coding.
 He was inspired by seeing children program with Logo, but wanted them to
 be able to program their own tools.

 Object-oriented programming splits code into logical classes that define
 the data for the object and the methods that access or modify that data.
 By splitting the code like this it becomes easier to organize and navigate
 more complex projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In tests some children programmed their own tools, like a twelve-year-old
 girl's painting application and a fifteen-year-old boy's circuit design
 application.
 Kay later referred to these impressive results as "early success syndrome."

The successes were real, but they weren't as general as we thought.

 it correctly.

\begin_layout Standard
Text-based programming languages have different requirements for syntax
 and indentation that if not followed perfectly will result in programs
 that do not run as expected (or at all).
 This can be frustrating for beginners and experienced coders alike -- most
 of my programming errors are missing semicolons or mismatched brackets.
 The creators of Scratch designed a coding system that works around syntax
 and the frustration of syntax errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scratch uses drag-and-drop 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

code blocks
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 instead of a text-based syntax, which makes coding less error-prone for
 beginners.
 These code blocks snap together only in ways that make syntactic sense
 (Figure

).
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Control structures (like 
\family typewriter
forever
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
repeat
\family default
) are C-shaped to suggest that blocks should be placed inside them.
 Blocks that output values are shaped according to the types of values they
 return: ovals for numbers and hexagons for Booleans.
 Conditional blocks (like 
\family typewriter
if
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
repeat-until
\family default
) have hexagon-shaped voids, indicating a Boolean is required.

Although creating a script with code blocks is more like snapping Legos
 together than writing code, it is still coding.
 The shape of the control structures is a direct metaphor to how code syntax
 works, and more visually obvious than brackets or indentation.

 I did not have this final output planned from the start.
 The available blocks influenced the direction of my exploration.
 For example, the last change was adding the drum sound when I saw that
 it was as easy as adding one more block to the script.
 Making something with comparable collision detection, color cycling, and
 audio triggering in Flash or Processing would have taken much longer.

This was my first Scratch project, and from launching the environment for

 create something interesting.
 I look forward to playing with it more.

My motivation to make this project comes from years of experimenting with

 I have worked in different languages and environments, but the ability

 technologies.
 I make my experiments into online creative tools (web apps) in order to
 see how other people use my creations.
\end_layout

In a way, Meemoo is an abstraction of all of my earlier digital creative

My first memory of interacting with a computer was with an Apple Macintosh
 that my father brought home from work in the mid-1980s.
 I have a strong visual memory of using the mouse to connect numbered dots
 to draw a star.
 Once the star was complete it briefly became animated.
 Seeing this graphic, however simple, react to my input and then come alive
 captured my imagination.
 We only had that computer for a few days, but I was hooked.

Because of timing or school priorities, I was not part of the small generation
 of students that was exposed to BASIC or LOGO programming in school.
 I remained interested in computers, spending any time that I could get
 my hands on them on shareware games and paint programs.
 I did not get into programming until high school, in two very different
 ways: Texas Instruments graphing calculators and web programming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My higher-level math classes used TI-8x series of graphing calculators.
 These have the ability to write and run programs with a BASIC-like syntax.
 My first program mirrored a game played by many children on standard calculator
s: the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+1 game.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This game is played by pressing the buttons [1] [+] [1] [=], and then pressing
 [=] as fast as possible.
 This makes the calculator into a counter, and we would have races to see
 who could press [=] fastest.
 Pressing buttons seems to be a common interest for children.
 When a system reacts to the button press, it gives the child a sense of
 control.
 The program that I wrote was just a few lines of code.
 It counted from zero, adding one and displaying the result in an infinite
 loop as fast as the calculator could go.
 I had automated the +1 game, taking out the button-pressing dynamic.
 It was satisfying to see the numbers flying by on the screen.
 I then made a new version of the script that printed the Fibonacci sequence
 in the same manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I then figured out how to script complicated graphic drawings on the small
 monochromatic screen.
 I would watch with interest as the calculator slowly rendered patterns
 from my scripts, one stroke at a time.
 This was my first experience with programming graphics.
 I never managed to make a program draw what I originally had in mind, but
 this was not discouraging.
 The serendipitous images that emerged from my experiments encouraged me
 to explore different directions, and create new challenges for myself.
 I learned a lot about cartesian geometry, algebra, and logic from these
 code explorations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scripting environment on these calculators gave them hackability.
 This afforded my creative exploration of math and graphical programming.

The availability of the Internet in my home spurred the second programming
 interest.
 It was empowering to publish my first web site.
 It was a

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where I could freely express myself in many different ways.
 Anybody in the world could see it, through the same window and at the same
 size and resolution as the websites of corporations, governments, and universit
ies.
 Learning how to create and post webpages gave me a level of active participatio
n that other media had not offered me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I learned web programming by example, mostly thanks to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 command on the browser.
 I would take a little bit of code from a tutorial, some code from another
 page's source, and tinker and experiment with the combination in an editor
 that showed both the code and output in the same window.
 These web programming experiments continued from this time and have culminated
 in this thesis project.

This project is the direct ancestor of Meemoo.
 I wanted to create a remixer for web video, including Youtube.
 The interface was split between controller and player, which were in separate
 HTML pages to allow the player page to be put on a separate monitor or
 projector.
 The controller page sent trigger signals as text to the player page using
 the same mechanism as the current Meemoo uses to send data from module
 to module.
 In early 2011 this mechanism,

 Around the middle of the year this limitation was lifted, allowing arbitrary

There were several types of controllers that could be used to remix the
 video.
 Each video had triggers that corresponded to the keys of the keyboard.
 Patterns could be made by typing these trigger keys.
 Then the patterns could be put in order in the sequencer.
 It is a complex system, and I never got around to actually using it.
 This is a pitfall of tool design that I would like to avoid in the future.
 Making these different kinds of music pattern sequencers into reconfigurable
 Meemoo modules will allow for more flexible tool design.

I have experience with two dataflow visual programming environments: Quartz
 Composer and Pure Data.
 The feeling of direct manipulation and immediate feedback in working with
 these environments appealed to me.
 I was able to do graphics and audio processing with them that I could not
 do with any text-based coding environment, so I was able to explore new
 kinds of audio/visual experiments.
 They are great tools for interactive installations, when you have control
 over the system.
 However, it is impossible to use them for creating web apps.

In order to design Meemoo for open modular hackability it must be easy for
 other people to create modules, analogous to jQuery's plugins.
 Meemoo modules are simple web pages that can be hosted anywhere.
 A module is referenced by its web address and loaded into the framework
 in an iframe.
 The framework surrounds the iframe with a resizable window with inputs
 on the left side at the top, and outputs on the right side on the bottom
 (Figure

 The inputs and outputs are then specified as in code sample

Usability design for hackability

The wiring view might be intimidating to some people at first glance.
 This is a tradeoff that every design makes, balancing simplicity and power.
 It is my hope that the simplicity of what is inside the modules will encourage
 people to explore the power in the framework.
 This is called a layered or spiral approach to learning, where success
 with one level encourages exploration in the next

Direct manipulation

\begin_layout Standard
One design difference between Meemoo and Quartz Composer is that Meemoo
 is able to have interface elements within each module.
 By way of example, an image filter module shows what it does to the image
 every time it receives image data (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Glitch-app"

\end_inset

).
 This should make it easier for people to understand how data flows through
 the application.

\begin_layout Subsection
What is abstracted
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Meemoo framework is a level of abstraction built on several levels of
 abstraction: JavaScript, browser, operating system, computer hardware.
 Modules can be made that do one programmatic function, which will lead
 to more apps with more modules and wires to build the logical functions
 required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My preference is to abstract away more logic in the JavaScript of the module.
 This makes each module a small self-contained application, like the paint
 module in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:Meemoo-screen-shot"

\end_inset

.
 I could have made the color picker from the paint application its own module.
 The framework dictates no preference to how much is abstracted into each
 module.

Graphic design

\begin_layout Standard
Pure Data has a quirky charm once you get over the initial steep learning
 curve, but some percentage of the charm is in being the only person on
 earth able to understand your own tangle of monochrome wires.
 One graphic design motivation was to make something nicer to look at and
 easier to understand at first glance than Pure Data.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
  I had people interact with Meemoo, sometimes freely and sometimes with
 prompts or goals to accomplish.
 As they interacted with the system, I asked them to speak their thought
 process aloud as much as possible.
 This method of testing allowed me to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

listen in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the thought process of the person using the system, making it easy to
 identify points of frustration.
 I recorded the sessions with screen-capture software for future reference
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Usability-testing"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tried to talk as little as possible, to see how people would interact
 with the framework if they had found it on their own.
 I reminded each person that I was not testing them, we were testing the
 usability of the project.
 I tested some people with no programming experience, and some people of
 varying experience with coding and visual programming.
 There were some usability issues that became quite obvious:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An introduction to the framework would be helpful to introduce the basic
 concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I left the design of the modules plain to focus on the design of the framework.
 This seemed to make some people miss the buttons within the modules, and
 start by moving wires around.
 I will need to make the inside of the modules the primary focus so that
 people do not unwire the apps before they understand what they do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Modules can specify the kind of data that ports send and accept.
 I could implement something like the shaped variables from Scratch's codeblocks
 to make it more obvious which ports can be wired together.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Connecting wires by drag and drop was easy for all levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Disconnecting wires is currently done by a less direct method that proved
 much less intuitive.
 First the port must be clicked to show the port information popup in which
 there is a button with a scissor icon to disconnect the wire (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Port-information"

\end_inset

).
 It was implemented this way as a temporary solution, and should be replaced
 with a direct method, more like pulling the wire out of the port.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is an indirect method to connect wires.
 The button for that also got in the way.
 The spacing between the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button and and the title of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

 section made people put those items together.
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Port-information"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is a method to input a value directly into the port from the port
 information popup.
 The submit function is a check-mark, which was overlooked by almost everybody.
 They tended instead to click on the button that says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

click,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 which has a different function.
 (Figure

Apps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large part of the development of Meemoo was creating apps with the framework.
 While creating apps, I think of processes that would have general purpose
 coded as a module.
 Coding modules helps me think about features that could be added to the
 framework.
 Adding to the module library gives more ideas about the kinds of apps that
 can be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have also made and written about two larger projects, an economic model
 and a VJ system.
 These two projects are quite different from each other.
 They show the breadth of possibility with this open framework.

 other people.
 For example, a film collective makes their work freely available on Pirate
 Bay.
 I download the film, enjoy it, and decide to give them a tip to show my
 appreciation.
 I see a tip widget on their website that explains that 10% of tips are
 deferred to each of three actors, 5% to a band on the soundtrack, etc.
 I send them $10, and the tip system divides and distributes the tip automatical
ly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These networks of tips could get quite complicated.
 The band's tips could be deferred to the band members.
 There could be two people that defer tips to each other.

 To make this simulation I wrote a Meemoo module that, when a number is
 input, sends the percentages defined to each output and keeps the rest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This application shows a nice feature of modular design.
 Each node in the graph is the same HTML module with different settings.
 This illustrates the object-oriented nature of the Meemoo framework, with
 modules that are like individual computers in a network that communicate
 with messages

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By making this model interactive software people can experiment with the
 system and see how tips to different nodes in the system get distributed.
 The model is built on Meemoo, so it is inherently hackable.
 If somebody disagrees with the model -- or has a similar idea -- they could
 fork the project and modify how it works to illustrate their point.
 This is an exciting possibility.

Partially thanks to this provocation, I decided to find a venue to perform

 I was invited to VJ at Zodiak's Side-Step dance festival club night on

 I used the gig as an opportunity to push Meemoo development and pressure-test
 the live-animation features.

For the gig I made some special modules for creating a "world" into which

 On the software development side, I am happy that I decided to make two
 modules (Controller and World, Figure

UX tweaks: Confirm dialog on every delete got annoying when juggling around
 modules.
 It would be better if there were an undo function, so delete could work
 without confirmation.
 A method for un/replugging wires that is more direct would make it quicker
 and easier to change the workings of the app.

I made a hack to open the World module in a new window to view it fullscreen

 I plan on making this a built-in feature for any module.

Despite these limitations, I got a lot of good feedback about the visuals.
 People were interested in what I was doing, and came around to play with
 the art supplies.
 Doing dance party visuals powered by a web browser was a fun experiment,
 and with a few more display options I think that the limitations would
 have been less aesthetically obvious.
 Performing under pressure was a good way to test the system.

Community for sharing apps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo was designed for sharing.
 I would like to take inspiration from elements of Reddit, Github, and an
 App Store to create a community for sharing and forking Meemoo apps.
 It will combine the community curation and subcommunities of Reddit, open
 source forking of Github, and the ease of use of an App Store (but the
 apps are hackable).
 Because of the small amount of source code to describe a Meemoo app it
 will be relatively easy to make such a community scalable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I imagine that a common point of entry to the community will be to see an
 image created with a Meemoo app.
 From there, you will be able to use the app that created the image.
 If you hack the app and want to save it, you can to your browser without
 signing in.
 If you want to save it publicly, you can sign up for the site at that point.
 I would like to make a design where the first priority is to enable creative
 hacking.
 Roping the person into signing up for the community would be a secondary
 priority.

\begin_layout Standard
An interesting possibility for a successful community would be tracing how
 modules and apps are forked through time.
 Each module can be considered the software manifestation of an idea, or
 meme.
 Ideas are recombinations of other ideas, and apps are recombinations of
 modules.
 That would make the source code of an app analogous to its DNA.
 The tree of forking and modification would be a direct map of the meme
 evolution of such a community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Socket communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A potential feature of a community is socket communication.
 This would allow people to send data from an app on one device to a different
 app on another device.
 For example, I could send an image from a small camera app on my phone
 to a stop-motion animation app on my laptop.
 This will allow devices with more limited capabilities to work in tandem
 with other devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could also be used to collaboratively edit Meemoo apps.
 This could have interesting uses in the classroom.
 For example, some students could be coding a game while other students
 are making the artwork for the game, with both groups able to see and test
 the results in real-time.
 This kind of collaboration happens in the online Scratch community, but
 due to software limitations it is not real-time

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo has the potential to become a powerful tool for creative programming
 on touchscreen devices.
 The library of modules reduces the need to write code in a text editor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gestures for zooming and panning are common in touchscreen interaction,
 and could be an intuitive way of navigating a Meemoo application.
 Since Meemoo runs in the browser, zooming and panning already work smoothly.
 Module dragging and wire connecting will take some more development time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meemoo runs in browser, and in general JavaScript is slower than native
 code.
 However, as the power of devices and browsers increase, the kinds of apps
 that can be built with Meemoo will likewise increase.

Websites such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

 are designed to streamline the experience of editing and sharing HTML experimen
ts and examples.
 The first screen of the site presents three text areas for HTML, CSS, and
 JavaScript, and a result frame that runs the web page output (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:jsFiddle"

\end_inset

).
 This site is used by JavaScript library developers to demonstrate bugs,
 as well as to make demonstrations for web programming questions and answers
 in forums such as StackOverflow.
 The immediacy of editing, saving, running, and sharing code in the browser
 makes this a time-saving tool for these communities.

I have been developing the first Meemoo modules using a traditional desktop
 code editor.
 I am used to switching between code editor and browser to test changes,
 and I probably make this mode switch hundreds of times per day.
 A code editor similar to jsFiddle that runs within Meemoo would eliminate
 the need to constantly switch applications to develop and test modules.
 Pressing

 From this view, there would be options to edit the current module (if you

The open-source programming environment DesignBlocksJS (Figure

 Combining these concepts, you could have the higher-level wiring hackability
 of Meemoo, and the lower-level coding hackability of codeblocks to edit
 the source of a Meemoo module.
 Programming modules with codeblocks would be a good transitional step between

The performance portion of this thesis was an enjoyable learning experience.
 I would like to take what I learned and build on this concept of live animation.
 It would be great to collaborate with musicians and build a story with

design a modular dataflow visual programming framework using web technologies.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I think that this concept has been proven.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will examine the secondary objectives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The framework should afford non-coders the ability to modify creative web
 apps by configuring wires that represent how modules communicate.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 According to usability testing, the framework does not yet satisfy this
 requirement for novices.
 I think that an interactive introduction to the Meemoo would help soften
 its learning curve.
 There are are also usability issues to address in the near future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Apps created with the framework should have source code that is easy to
 read and share.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This has been accomplished by designing the source code to be as simple
 as possible.
 The complexity of each module's code is abstracted to its web address,
 so the URL the and the state of the module are all that is needed.
 The source code format of Meemoo apps is both concise and open-ended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Web coders should be able to extend the framework by creating modules using
 web standards.
 There should be a simple syntax to define the inputs and outputs of a module.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I am the only person that has written Meemoo modules, so I do not yet have
 any feedback from other people on this point.
 I designed the library to be simple to use for people with JavaScript experienc
e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have made a framework that I look forward to building on for a long time.
 It is open-ended enough that the possibilities are limitless.
 The capabilities will increase with the capabilities of web browsers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have been designing this framework for myself, but with an eye to a potential
 future where others might find it valuable.
 I am interested to see what other people might build with it.
